## Plop

The components files can be automatically generated using plop with the command below:

```bash
$ npm run plop
```

You can create a component directly in the CLI without need to do step by step with the command below:

```bash
$ npm run plop component COMPONENT_NAME
```

or a short version of it:

```bash
$ npm run plop c COMPONENT_NAME
```

With this way we can use the terminal folder autocomplete and is easier/faster to be used.
